        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently teaching myself front-end web development with the
          intention of changing career in the next 6-9 months. By following the
          Codecademy Front-End Developer track and using highly recommended
          Udemy courses, I'm learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. In
          addition, I plan to learn more about using Git, Github, Command Line
          (usin GitBash) to get myself ready for professional work.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment I work as a Senior Scientist for the UK Health Security
          Agency. I have my time as a scientist and learning lots about
          microbiology and biomedical sciences. However, after years of doing
          this I've developed a stronger interest in web design and development.

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Here is a record of the projects I have completed starting with the
          most recent. I've included links to view my finished projects and each
          respective repository to view their coding.

          <li>
            <a href="#"><h3>Static Blog Page</h3></a>
            Blog Webite
            <p>Built using only HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>
              The project itself was part of the Udemy course

                >Build Responsive Real-World Websites wth HTML and CSS by Jonas
                Schmedtmann</a
              >. Although I will be tweaking this as I go to make it my own full
              credit is given to the instructor.

              This is just a placeholder for future projects. I'm not expecting
              anyone to currently be viewing this page and I want to play around
              with design and layouts. Therefore it makes sense to me to have
              this here.

          At this point I really don't expect anybody to get in touch, However,
          if you do just pop me a quick email:
